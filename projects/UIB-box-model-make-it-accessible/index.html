            <h2 id="access">What is Accessibility?</h2>
            <p>
                <abbr>Accessibility</abbr> (often abbreviated to A11y—as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
                For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and no matter
                how they access the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement,
                sight, and cognitive ability."

            <p>
                Individuals living with a disability use assistive technologies such as the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen reading software</li>
                <li>Braille terminals</li>
                <li>Screen magnification software</li>
                <li>Speech recognition software</li>
                <li>Keyboard overlays</li>
                <li>Subtitled videos</li>

            <h2 id="bottom">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                The accessibility of websites relies on the cooperation of several components:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>content – the information in a web page or web application</li>
                <li>web browsers, media players, and other "user agents"</li>
                <li>
                    assistive technology, in some cases – screen readers, alternative keyboards, switches, scanning software, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    users' knowledge, experiences, and in some cases, adaptive strategies using the web
                </li>
                <li>
                    developers – designers, coders, authors, etc., including developers with disabilities and users who contribute content
                </li>
                <li>authoring tools – software that creates websites</li>
                <li>
                    evaluation tools – web accessibility evaluation tools, HTML validators, CSS validators, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>
